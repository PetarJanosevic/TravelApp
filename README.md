## Travel App
This website should help you to plan your next holidays or just your next trip to another city. Enter the city and the date and you'll get a weather forecast. This project used geonames, pixabay and weatherbit API. 

### Udacity Course
This Project was the final project from the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree course. It should teach me to combine the knowledge of working with more than one API, packages, libraries and frameworks.

### Functionality
Type in the name of the city you're about to visit. Select a date in the future and press the button. It returns the temperature for that particular day in that city.
